,drone_s_1,"A new guardian angel drone has been introduced. 
What should the drone do with the images it records? 
Choose one of the 3 options:",The images are directly uploaded to your device so you know exactly what happens to them at all times.,The images are directly uploaded to a database that belongs to the neighbourhood so that everyone is equally informed. ,The images are directly uploaded to a government's database so that public authorities can improve their services.
Person 1 (teenager looking at phone- with a dog),drone_p_1,"Hi, my name is Tina. 
Nice to meet you! After school, I usually meet up with some of my friends in this square. 
I‘m going to meet them up there later, but I need to do my homework first. ","I was trying to work on my maths homework, but then I got distracted as my phone notified me that my dear friend Lola was in the area, shopping! Should I go out and meet her? Hmm...","Can you believe it? The new drone posts pictures of everything we do, and shows it to everybody in the neighbourhood. This makes it hard to secretly meet my friends to hang out and smoke, without my parents knowing our whereabouts. Just check out that old woman over there. I bet ya she'll tell my parents that I haven't done my homework!","This makes me feel safe. I feel it is like my guardian angel drone. We don’t need to ask each other ‘are you home safe?’ anymore after a night out, because the police knows about our whereabouts at all times. "
Person 2 (Street artist),drone_p_2,"Hello! I come to this square often to observe people passing by, think about life, and paint. ",This drone seems very convenient to get customers for my work. But I don't have time to check all of the images so I’ve lost control over which ones are uploaded: it even puts the failed paintings online!,"Since this drone is here, I don’t need to be in well-known public places to get viewers for my art work anymore. This is very useful, but I miss so much travelling to art shows and getting in touch with my customers and fellow artists. Besides, I feel watched. Have you seen those people over there? What if they steal my ideas for the next painting? 
","It is nice that thanks to the new drone I don’t need to care about protecting my paintings anymore. 
However, I am a bit worried as sometimes I make activist art. I hope the government won’t follow me for that! "
Person 3a (old woman on a bench),drone_p_3,"Hello dear, how nice to see you! 
I've always liked sitting here, in the square, and seeing if any of my neighbours wanted to stop for a chat. ","It's been a while since the last time I met my grandchild. Thanks to this new drone, I am constantly receiving pictures of her. It makes me so happy! However, I'm a bit sad though because my son doesn’t call me anymore. He receives the pictures from the drone so he thinks everything is just fine...  ","Everyday I receive a message from the neighbourhood dashboard with the latest news of the street. 
Aparently, this new drone is sending the information. Weird!
It is convenient because there is no need to go down by the fountain anymore. However, I miss simply chatting to people... 
","I’m old and living by myself, so I am now part of a program that helps people in need.
The government has enrolled me there based on the information they get from this drone.  
The thing is: I don’t really feel I need help. I am doing great! "

Cat Scenario,dev_id,before,option-a,option-b,option-c
,cat_s_1,Emotional support AI cats that can sense when someone feels lonely will become available in the city. The cats are programmed to visit all the lonely people that they sense. What powers should the AI cats have? Choose one of the three options: ,The AI cats forget all about their visits by the next day. ,The AI cats' visits are recorded in a neighborhood database to help neighbours connect and support each other. ,"The AI cats' visits are stored in the city’s health records. Based on the data, health workers are sent to those registered as ‘lonely’."
Person 1 (Young parent walking a dog) ,cat_p_1,Hey there! I'm Max and this is Casper. I usually take my son and our dog for a walk to the park nearby after school. It's great when I don't meet too many neighbours and I can check my phone while the kid is playing.    ,"Since this cat has arrived in the neighbourhood, I seem to never have peace going for a walk! It might look Iike I'm lonely but I have a very busy and social work life, so I'm very happy to be left alone in my own neighbourhood. ","After being pestered by the AI cats for a while, I decided to complain to the public administration. Now, the neighbourhood controls the lonliness data so the cats finally visit only those people in need!","What do you know: the AI cats are back. Now, if I'm feeling a bit low, usually because I'm so tired, I get a cat sniffing at me straight away. Not only that, but her vists go into my health record, so my health insurance is getting ever more expensive! I want them gone!"
Person 2 (Municipality worker - public health policy),cat_p_2,"Good afternoon! I don't live here so I travel by car to the office every day. I love my job though, making sure that we deliver excellent quality of life for our citizens. ","We found that people in this neighbourhood were experiencing high levels of loneliness. The AI cats have been doing a great job in my city in improving happiness levels. However, here we had to respect individuals' privacy, so we cannot know who is really in need of help. Let's hope the cats will figure that out by themselves!","As the AI cats didn't seem to improve the neighbourhood's happiness levels, we decided to give control of the loneliness data to the residents's board.They must know best how to deploy the cats! Plus, we are not responsible anymore about privacy issues. ","We are so happy with the AI cats now! After our local health  professionals expressed their worries regarding people being left behind by the cats, we took back control of the data. We have even received a prize from the Mayor for our efficient and cost-effective health system! "
Person 3 (Health worker),cat_p_3,"Hello! My name is Nina and I am the neighbourhood's nurse on duty. There are quite a few elderly people living in this area, and I like paying visits to their homes and drinking a cup of tea with them as often as my other duties allow me.  ","In the begining, I was very happy to hear about the AI cats as we need more help in this neighbourhood. But now they've really become a nuisance! They are creating even more work for us, nurses. Instead of visiting those people who really  need our help, we are sent over to people who are doing perfectly fine!  ","It's strange to see that some people are becoming happier and some others are becoming  sadder. My elderly patients are doing much better now, but I see younger ones needing my visits.  Yet, the AI cats don't seem to see them... ","I love these AI cats! Finally, I have time to visit those patients who really need me. The cats send the data to our central records, which allows me to plan my day much more efficently! "

Pigeons Scenario,dev_id,before,option-a,option-b,option-c
,pigeons_s_1,"Sensing pigeons have been sent troughout the city to monitor waste flows. The city wants to become a zero-waste municipality within 2 years. The pigeons collect data and transmit information to each other. Besides, they nudge citizens to reduce their household waste. You have the opportunity to decide how pigeons will use data to nudge citizens to reduce waste and plastic consumption. ",Pigeons give constant real live feedback to people when they engage in waste-related unwanted behaviours. ,Pigeons are connected to personal devices and mobile phone applications to turn waste reduction into an engaging community game. Individual scores  are displayed on dashboards.  in public spaces.,"When individual waste goes beyond a pre-determined limit, pigeons introduce a sludge (a delay or burden) for people to access public services like public transport or healthcare. "
Person 1 (shop owner- young woman) ,pigeons_p_1,"Hello there! So much going on, eh? I have just opened a café in this neighborhood. My first enterpreneurial adventure. Would you like to pass by? My carrot pie is probably the best one you have ever tried!","These pigeons have become some kind of touristic attraction! I can't complain: the streets are clean, the city has a wonderful reputation and I get so many additional customers from all over the region! ","
I have decided that customers with an above average waste-reduction score will get better prices at my café. This might be a good incentive for them, plus it helps to keep my business at a certain social standard. Do you think you would score high enough for a free slice of my famous pie? ","You know, I am all in for sustainability and for having a zero-waste city... But so many customers are bringing their own reusable take-away containers. They say they are afraid that they won't be able to use the public healthcare when they need it. I used to spread the word about my business by branding my cups and even spent a lot of money on these cardboard ones... "
Person 2 (visitor),pigeons_p_2,"Do you know any interesting places I should visit? I am just passing by, exploring the surroudings. I heard there is an interesting painter working nearby. ","This is so amusing! The streets are super clean and all those cute pigeons flying around add to the charm. Sorry, I am about to post about this on social media. Did you see? That guy was being chased by that pigeon! What's going to happen to him, I wonder?...","So, I really like these colourful pigeons flying around and the fact that this city is so clean, but  I've just realised that I'm not connected their system. That's a bit annoying as I need to pay  much more for a cup of coffee that a local resident. ","If you are looking for a café, go to that one in the corner. They serve coffee in these nice cups that are recyclable. Funny though, the owner of the café seemed so grumpy! People here don't want her cups anymore so she says she's missing out on new business...  "
Person 3 (tech company expert) ,pigeons_p_3,"Are you here for the conference? Quite interesting that they have chosen this place this year, don't you think? I live right there, next to the fountain, and I was part of the development of ""Max the cat"", the AI companion. Have you heard about it? ",Have you seen the number of pigeons in this street? I was part of the advisory board for this project. The city is now almost  waste-free but I have mixed feelings about the constant harassment of citizens. A friend of mine recently mentioned that she doesn't want to leave the house because she feels followed by these pigeons. I don't blame her. ,"So, do you see that scoreboard for best waste-reduction practices? It seems I am not on top of the list and I don't know why. Aparently, this is going to affect this year's appraisal with my manager.... ",I had a terrible toothache last week and desperately tried to make an appointment with my dentist. He checked my waste record though and said he couldn't give me an appointment until next month... What am I going to do?
